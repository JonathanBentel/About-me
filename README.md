- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JonathanBentel
- ðŸ‘€ I am currently making a career change into IT after 7 years in law enforcment. 
- I currently have an associates degree from Delgado Communit College in information systems with plans to go on to get a bachelors degree in computer science.
- I am currently teaching myself variouse skills on microsoft Server 2016 with active directory and Microsoft Exchange through virtual box.
- To add on to this I am going back to coding and I am currently working on learning to code in C#. 
- After I get a bit of experience I plan to make a simple application to track my weight lifting max's.
- I also found a forum post that throws out a large amount of project ideas that I will play with in time.
- To anyone looking at my profile, I am currently no where near being an expert at coding or even possesing working knowledge.
